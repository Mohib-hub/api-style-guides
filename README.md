# Sabre API Style Guides

## What is This?
 
This is a collection of **API Style Guides** used at [Sabre](https://www.sabre.com/). It's a way for us to all work better together in the service of providing a fantastic developer experience (DX) for the customers using our future Sabre APIs.
 
Style Guides are a way of accelerating API development by listing best-practices that we have learned, put into production, and want to adopt. Use it as a blueprint for your API development. We're promoting this as a jumping-off point to help you start working more quickly.
 
We have a goal of providing a common look and feel for building API interfaces used by our customers. Requests and responses are a user interface (UI) for developers. We want our APIs to collectively produce a UI that's clean, consistent, and highly capable.
 
The business outcome of having a set of shared API Style Guides is helping us treat APIs as products. Each API is a product, and they ought to feel as though they were all made by the same company, and look like they fit inside the same Sabre universe.
 
If our [portfolio of APIs](https://developer.sabre.com/) does this we anticipate the experience our developer customers have with our APIs will be a positive one. Developer experience (DX) for a platform company is highly crucial for adoption, engagement, and monetization. One customer-SVP noted about his engineering team selecting technology providers:

> "Developers are increasingly influential, and their opinions drive changes."
 
## How Did We Approach This?
 
The [RESTful Style Guide](RESTfulAPIStyleGuide.md) was originally authored by Ken Tabor in August through September of 2017 while working with the Travel Network team building the Corporate Travel Services APIs. Many of you might remember reading this during that time.
 
The guide began heavily influenced by the Paypal API Style Guide, and from there revised and updated. This guide's content consists of:
 
* Industry best-practices discovered during research. Subjects studied includes many popular "Hero Companies" who are leading the way regarding APIs and platforms.
* Recommendations from Apigee white-papers. Also, including input from various online articles and conference videos from subject-matter thought-leaders.
* Updates guided by three rounds of feedback received from interested members of Sabre's architect and developer community.

Ongoing improvements are welcomed by all contributors.     
 
## Where Is It?
 
The [**RESTful API Style Guide**](RESTfulAPIStyleGuide.md), being an artifact for developers, is under revision control in this git repo.
 
## Asking for Your Help
 
Our goal is getting your feedback to make it better, and to see how we can apply this when building customer-facing APIs.
